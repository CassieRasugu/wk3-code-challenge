//This e-commerce product reviews application is developed using Ruby on Rails and ActiveRecord, providing a platform for users to review various products. The application utilizes three main models: User, Product, and Review, each serving a specific purpose in managing the relationships between users and products. These models are designed with the help of ActiveRecord associations, such as has_many, belongs_to, and has_many :through, to establish the necessary connections.
